# day-27_mi_to_km
Day 27 of 100.

Simple converter. Working with GUIs (Graphical User Interface). The main focus was building the window, making sure the button works, and that it outputs the solution to the math it does in the background. Exit: 🐢. Enter: tkinter! User need only input the number of miles they wish to be converted, and press the 'convert' button.
